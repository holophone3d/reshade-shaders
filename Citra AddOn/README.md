## Citra Add-On + Citra.fx Effect for ReShade

### ðŸš§ \*\* **Work in Progress** \*\*

**Note** if ReShade is a little too advanced for you, try starting with the shader-only setup. No ReShade needed, just Citra + a custom [Looking Glass Interlacing Shader for Citra](https://github.com/jakedowns/reshade-shaders/tree/main/interlaced-shader)

NOTE in order to test this, you'll need a custom build of Citra. You can build it yourself from this [tagged commit](https://github.com/jakedowns/citra-fix-custom-interlaced-shader-path/tree/reshade-left-eye-optional), or [download the citra-qt.exe from the release page here](https://github.com/jakedowns/citra-fix-custom-interlaced-shader-path/releases/tag/reshade-left-eye-optional)

Hopefully the pull request to fix this gets merged: https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/pull/6140
or, i'll find another way to capture the left-eye's depth buffer to negate the need for this patch

### Features:
- normalizes Citra's depth buffers to be usable by other existing ReShade effects
  - rotates depth buffer so x,y uv coordinates are correct
  - inverts depth values so bright values are near and dark values are far
  - supports setting a fixed depth for the bottom screen when in split-screen mode

### How:
- basically a clone of the Generic Depth addon, that remaps all calls from other effects/addons looking to access the `DEPTH` texture to instead access a pre-processed depth texture, specially modified to normalize it from Citra's emulation-specific values to something more standardly consumable by other shader effects pipelines

### Installation:
1. download [`citra.addon`](./citra.addon) (64-bit) OR [`citra32.addon`](./citra32.addon) (32-bit) into the same directory as `ReShade.ini` and `citra-qt.exe`
2. place `Citra.fx` in `./reshade-shaders/Shaders/` sub-directory within the Citra executable folder
4. start citra. (if it crashes or reshade doesn't launch, disable generic depth, edit ReShade.ini:
```
[ADDON]
DisabledAddons=Generic Depth
```
5. start citra. press `home` to bring up ReShade **Important** Disable the `Generic Depth` add-on
6. make sure `Citra` is enabled in the add-ons tab
7. make sure the `Citra` effect is enabled in the home tab, and that it's at the top of the effects list

### Known Issues

- currently, if you have too many, or too intense fx enabled, or resolution too high, you might see flickering.

  this is due to the fact that many games share a single depth buffer. i'm still working on a solution to prevent this.

- currently the "left, right, small" side-by-side modes are unfinished and require manual offset adjustments

- scaling adjustments and aspect adjustments need re-enabled

- certain window dimensions require a lot of manual offset adjustments, i'm working on automating these

I simply packaged them up.
