Gist Overview of adding Citra Support for ReShade

NOTE: i'm currently working on packaging all this up into a Citra add-on for ReShade. I'll post on reshade / citra subreddits when it's ready. feel free to follow me on twitter for updates as well: https://twitter.com/jakedowns You can also subscribe to this github repo for updates

### Devlog

#### 9.29.2022

made a little progress on my ReShade integration tonight.
I got some advice from the author crosire, who gave me a basic setup for how i can write out a modified depth buffer on the ReShade side, and then write an addon that will swap my modified / pre-formatted depth buffer for any additonal reshade effects that access it.

it's not totally working yet, but it is showing some promising signs of life.

excited to get this working.
here's the code for anyone interested: https://github.com/jakedowns/reshade-shaders/commit/68767eddaffe92ab32cf63cc2eefeec202d301b7

there is something interesting of note tho.

When StereoRenderOption is set to Off renderer_opengl renders the Left eye to the rgb buffer. However, by the time a frame completes, the one and only Depth buffer presented to ReShade is showing the depth/normals for the Right eye

on my local build, i hard-coded it to draw the right eye, but maybe i could add an option for Left or Right when 3d mode is set to off? happy to make the default Left if it needs to be.
